# problem-chimp

My personal website at [problemchimp.org](http://problemchimp.org), using [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Bootstrap settings
The customized Bootstrap CSS is available from http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=02f54ab22136b1a190db


## Build and run
To run it, install [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/) then `make run`.

The site is currently deployed to [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com/) using the ```app.yaml``` inside the "deploy" directory.
