{% mark excerpt -%}

In September 2013, the [ICT curriculum in schools was replaced by Computer
Science][bbc-news], with a greater emphasis on using computers to create 
software rather than simply using it. As a [Code Club Pro][code-club-pro] 
volunteer, I'm aware that there are some [fantastic resources][barefoot] to 
help schools with this (and if you're a teacher interested in training, 
[do sign up][code-club-pro-book]). However, good resources for preschoolers 
are a little harder to come by.

This article focuses on using an actual computer, rather than on the many 
[excellent apps][originator] available for tablet and mobile . Why? Because 
I believe [computers are a better tool than tablets for writing anything]
[computers-vs-tablets], including code. So if we want our children to be 
coders and not merely consumers, then keyboard-and-mouse-style interaction 
is still important. On a more practical level, tablets are still less 
ubiquitous than computers, and this has a knock-on effect on the availability
of some educational apps. For example, [ScratchJr], [Jolly Phonics]
[jolly-phonics] and [Teach Your Monster to Read][teach-your-monster-to-read] 
are available online and for iOS, but [not yet for Android][guardian-apps-ios].

I need to get a couple more preliminaries out of the way before I move on to
the apps themselves. First, security. Do not, under any circumstances, let 
your toddler use your computer with your user account. My child can press 
buttons in combinations that I have never seen and don't understand, and so 
will yours. Instructions for setting up a separate account on Windows are 
[here][windows-8-security]; Mac instructions [here][mac-security].

Second, usability. Computers are designed primarily for adults, not children, 
so a booster seat and/or a smaller mouse can be helpful. If your child 
likes looking at letters and numbers, they may benefit from enlarged text. If 
they are left-handed, make sure you (and their teachers) know 
[how to reverse the mouse buttons][make-your-mouse-left-handed] if that's 
what they prefer. If your child is likely to have more substantial difficulties 
using a standard computer, then the [BBC accessibility guide][bbc-accessiblity] 
is a good place to start.

On to the apps.

<h3>1. Calculator and Notepad</h3>
I really wanted my child's first experience of a computer to be fun, so I 
didn't want him to come up against his lack of mouse control straight away.
He's always enjoyed pressing the buttons on the phone, so I thought he might
enjoy some simple typing to start with. He did, and still does.

<h3>2. SnapBubbles</h3>
For developing mouse skills, it doesn't get much simpler than [bubble wrap]
[snapbubbles].

<h3>3. CBeebies Make a Picture</h3>
Once we had the basics of moving and clicking, the [CBeebies Make a Picture]
[cbeebies-make-a-picture] games were perfect for extra practice and for 
learning to hold down the button while moving the mouse.

<h3>4. Fungooms </h3>
What I like most about [Fungooms] is that it has a large number of games, but
it's so well designed that my 3-year-old can navigate the whole site without 
any assistance from me. Also, it somehow manages to be appealing to children 
without being annoying to adults - after a bad night, I even find the
music relaxing. Definitely worth a look.

<h3>5. Everything else </h3>
Obviously far too many to list here, but I should at 
least mention [ScratchJr] and 
[Teach Your Monster to Read][teach-your-monster-to-read], as well as character 
games like [Thomas the Tank Engine][thomas-the-tank-engine] and 
[Peppa Pig][peppa-pig].
