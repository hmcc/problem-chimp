In September 2013, the [ICT curriculum in schools was replaced by Computer
Science][bbc-news], with a greater emphasis on using computers to create 
software rather than simply using it. As a [Code Club Pro][code-club-pro] 
volunteer, I'm aware that there are some [fantastic resources][barefoot] to 
help schools with this (and if you're a teacher interested in training, 
[do sign up][code-club-pro-book]). However, good resources for preschoolers 
are a little harder to come by.

This article focuses on using an actual computer, rather than on the many 
[excellent apps][originator] available for tablet and mobile . Tablets are 
still less ubiquitous than computers, and this has a knock-on effect on the 
availability of some educational apps. For example, [ScratchJr] and 
[Teach Your Monster to Read][teach-your-monster-to-read] are available online 
and for iOS, but [not yet for Android][guardian-apps-ios].

I need to get a couple more preliminaries out of the way before I move on to
the apps themselves. First, security. Do not, under any circumstances, let 
your toddler use your computer with your user account. My child can press 
buttons in combinations that I have never seen and don't understand, and so 
will yours. Instructions for setting up a separate account on Windows are 
[here][windows-8-security]; Mac instructions [here][mac-security].

Second, usability. Computers are designed primarily for adults, so a booster 
seat and/or a smaller mouse can be helpful. If your child likes looking at 
letters and numbers, they may benefit from enlarged text. If they are 
left-handed, make sure you (and their teachers) know 
[how to reverse the mouse buttons][make-your-mouse-left-handed] if that's 
what they prefer. If you need to make more substantial adjustments, 
then the [BBC accessibility guide][bbc-accessiblity] is a good place to start.

On to the apps.

<h3>1. Calculator and Notepad</h3>
I really wanted my child's first experience of a computer to be fun, so I 
didn't want him to come up against his lack of mouse control straight away.
He's always enjoyed pressing the buttons on the phone, so I thought he might
enjoy some simple typing to start with. He did, and still does.

<h3>2. SnapBubbles</h3>
For developing mouse skills, it doesn't get much simpler than [bubble wrap]
[snapbubbles].

<h3>3. CBeebies Make a Picture</h3>
Once we had the basics of moving and clicking, the [CBeebies Make a Picture]
[cbeebies-make-a-picture] games were perfect for extra practice and for 
learning to hold down the button while moving the mouse. The pictures are
printable from within the app, or to save on printer ink while maintaining
that sense of achievement, set it as the desktop background instead.

<h3>4. Fungooms </h3>
What I like most about [Fungooms] is that it has a large number of games, but
it's so well designed that my 3-year-old can navigate the whole site without 
any assistance from me. Also, it somehow manages to be appealing to children 
without being annoying to adults - I'll even admit that I find the
music relaxing. Definitely worth a look.

<h3>5. Everything else </h3>
Once your preschooler has the basics of mouse movement and site navigation, 
they should be able to enjoy pretty much anything aimed at their age group.
Good sites include:

 * The rest of [CBeebies] - try [Matching Pairs][cbeebies-pairs], [Get Squiggling][cbeebies-get-squiggling], [Alphablocks][cbeebies-alphablocks] or [The Lingo Show][cbeebies-lingo-show]
 * [Peppa Pig][peppa-pig]
 * [ScratchJr][scratchjr]
 * [Teach Your Monster to Read][teach-your-monster-to-read]
 * [Up To Ten][uptoten] - some games are more difficult than others; try [Spot the Difference][uptoten-spot-the-difference]


Enjoy!
