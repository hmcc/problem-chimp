To experiment with distributed systems, I've decided to first build a
[skeleton project](distributed-systems-getting-started-2.html) in Java that
will announce itself on the network and send messages to other instances of
itself. In other words, I'm building a chat application.

{%- endmark %}


Java has 3 main options for sending messages using
[sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket):

1. [java.net](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/index.html): the original method, providing classes for blocking IO with TCP/UDP
2. [java.nio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_I/O_(Java)): newer than java.net, provides blocking or non-blocking IO using buffers
3. [java.nio2](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nio2-1/index.html): similar to java.nio, but adds an asynchronous API

The difference between blocking and non-blocking IO is that with blocking IO,
the socket thread will wait until it receives a response, so to serve many
clients, you'll need many threads. With non-blocking IO, requests return
immediately (even if there is no data), so many clients can be served with a
single thread. (For a fuller explanation, try
[Blocking I/O and non-blocking I/O](https://medium.com/coderscorner/tale-of-client-server-and-socket-a6ef54a74763)
by Rukshani Athapathu.)

If I was coding a professional chat application, there would be a
[debate](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/267306/java-net-versus-java-nio)
to be had about whether java.nio is actually necessary to support the expected
number of connections. Since I'm not, I'm simply going with my
gut feeling, which is that using java.nio is just good practice (and not
actually all that hard).

Many [java.nio tutorials](https://crunchify.com/java-nio-non-blocking-io-with-server-client-example-java-nio-bytebuffer-and-channels-selector-java-nio-vs-io/)
follow a client-server pattern (which doesn't really work for a distributed
system since it introduces a single point of failure) so here's a quick
overview of how to write an application that's capable of doing both.

**1. Get a Selector**

The [Selector](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/Selector.html)
class is central to non-blocking IO with Java. It's used to examine one or more
[channels](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SelectableChannel.html)
and find out what (if anything) they are ready to do. The 4 possible operations
are Accept, Connect, Read and Write.

<pre>
Selector selector <span class="pl-k">=</span> Selector<span class="pl-k">.</span>open();
</pre>

**2. Start listening**

Open a port to which other clients can connect, and register this with the
selector so that it knows we are interested in the "accept" event.

<pre>
ServerSocketChannel serverChannel <span class="pl-k">=</span> ServerSocketChannel<span class="pl-k">.</span>open();
serverChannel<span class="pl-k">.</span>configureBlocking(<span class="pl-cl">false</span>);
InetSocketAddress address <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-k">new</span> InetSocketAddress(<span class="pl-s">"localhost"</span>, port);
serverChannel<span class="pl-k">.</span>socket()<span class="pl-k">.</span>bind(address);

serverChannel<span class="pl-k">.</span>register(selector, SelectionKey<span class="pl-k">.</span><span class="pl-cl">OP_ACCEPT</span>);
</pre>

**3. Accept incoming connections**

When a client connects to us, we want to accept the connection, put the channel
into non-blocking mode, and register that we are interested in reading and
writing.

<pre>
<span class="pl-k">private void</span> <span class="pl-en">accept</span>(SelectionKey <span class="pl-v">key</span>) {
    ServerSocketChannel serverChannel <span class="pl-k">=</span> (ServerSocketChannel) key<span class="pl-k">.</span>channel();
    SocketChannel channel <span class="pl-k">=</span> serverChannel<span class="pl-k">.</span>accept();

    <span class="pl-c">// Configure the connection as non-blocking, and register it as readable and writable</span>
    channel<span class="pl-k">.</span>configureBlocking(<span class="pl-cl">false</span>);
    channel<span class="pl-k">.</span>register(selector, SelectionKey<span class="pl-k">.</span><span class="pl-cl">OP_READ</span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> SelectionKey<span class="pl-k">.</span><span class="pl-cl">OP_WRITE</span>);
}
</pre>

**4. Make outgoing connections**

To act as both client and server, the application shouldn't just accept
incoming connections, but should make outgoing connections too.

Until I set up
[service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery), I'm just
going to give the application a port range, listen on the first available port
in that range, and attempt to connect to the others. To make a single outgoing
connection:

<pre>
InetSocketAddress address <span class="pl-k">=</span> new InetSocketAddress(<span class="pl-s">"localhost"</span>, port);
SocketChannel channel <span class="pl-k">=</span> SocketChannel<span class="pl-k">.</span>open(address);

<span class="pl-c">// Configure the connection as non-blocking, and register it as readable and writable</span>
channel<span class="pl-k">.</span>configureBlocking(<span class="pl-cl">false</span>);
channel<span class="pl-k">.</span>register(selector, SelectionKey<span class="pl-k">.</span><span class="pl-cl">OP_READ</span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> SelectionKey<span class="pl-k">.</span><span class="pl-cl">OP_WRITE</span>);
</pre>

**5. Read and write**

Read from and write to the socket using
[ByteBuffer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html)s.

<pre>
<span class="pl-k">private void</span> <span class="pl-en">read</span>(SelectionKey <span class="pl-v">key</span>) {
    SocketChannel channel <span class="pl-k">=</span> (SocketChannel) key<span class="pl-k">.</span>channel();
    ByteBuffer buffer <span class="pl-k">=</span> ByteBuffer<span class="pl-k">.</span>allocate(<span class="pl-cl">1024</span>);
    <span class="pl-k">int</span> numRead <span class="pl-k">=</span> channel<span class="pl-k">.</span>read(buffer);
    <span class="pl-k">if</span> (numRead <span class="pl-k">==</span> <span class="pl-k">-</span><span class="pl-cl">1</span>) {
        return;
    }
    <span class="pl-k">byte</span>[] data <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-k">new</span> byte[numRead];
    System<span class="pl-k">.</span>arraycopy(buffer<span class="pl-k">.</span>array(), <span class="pl-cl">0</span>, data, <span class="pl-cl">0</span>, numRead);
    ...
}
</pre>

<pre>
<span class="pl-k">private void</span> <span class="pl-en">write</span>(SelectionKey <span class="pl-v">key</span>) {
    SocketChannel channel <span class="pl-k">=</span> (SocketChannel) key<span class="pl-k">.</span>channel();
    ByteBuffer bufferedMessage <span class="pl-k">=</span> ByteBuffer<span class="pl-k">.</span>wrap(message);
    <span class="pl-k">int</span> written <span class="pl-k">=</span> channel<span class="pl-k">.</span>write(bufferedMessage);
    ...
}
</pre>

**6. Put it all together: query the Selector and handle the result**

<pre>
Iterator<SelectionKey> keyIterator <span class="pl-k">=</span> selector<span class="pl-k">.</span>selectedKeys()<span class="pl-k">.</span>iterator();
<span class="pl-k">while</span> (keyIterator<span class="pl-k">.</span>hasNext()) {
    
    SelectionKey key <span class="pl-k">=</span> keyIterator<span class="pl-k">.</span>next();
    <span class="pl-k">if</span> (key<span class="pl-k">.</span>isAcceptable()) {
        <span class="pl-c">// accept the connection</span>
        accept(key);

    } <span class="pl-k">else if</span> (key<span class="pl-k">.</span>isReadable()) {
        <span class="pl-c">// read data</span>
        read(key);
            
    } <span class="pl-k">else if</span> (key<span class="pl-k">.</span>isWritable()) {
        <span class="pl-c">// write to the socket</span>
        write(key, message);
    }
    
    <span class="pl-c">// very important: remove the key to be notified of future events</span>
    keyIterator<span class="pl-k">.</span>remove();
}
</pre>
