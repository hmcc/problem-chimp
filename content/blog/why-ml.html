{% mark excerpt -%}

I got into Machine Learning and Distributed Systems by accident.
(It would be hard to have got into them on purpose, because when I started out
in 2005, they weren't really things that a "normal" developer would do - back
then, Facebook was still a closed network, and Twitter hadn't been invented
yet.)

I [don't come from a traditional software engineering background](/about), so
I spent the first few years of my career being grateful that I had a job in
this field at all, and the next few doing fairly standard software development
roles while trying to climb the corporate ladder. I'm still not sure whether
having kids was the worst thing to happen to my career, or the best - but
either way it
[forced a shift](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/soozi-baggs/the-mummy-track---a-man-made-trap_b_5248060.html).
I found myself looking for a job at 4 months pregnant, and the lovely person
who was prepared to see past the bump and hire me was
[Mike](https://github.com/kothar) at [Stashmetrics](http://stashmetrics.com/).

Stashmetrics aimed to automate the process of finding and evaluating 
[influencers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing). The app
consumed as much Twitter (and later YouTube and Instagram) as the rate limit
would allow, and did all kinds of clever things with social graphs and content
analysis to suggest potential influencers, given a couple of seeds. (For
example, if you wanted more influencers like
[Zoe Sugg](https://www.instagram.com/zoella/?hl=en), it would suggest
[Samantha Chapman](https://www.instagram.com/pixiwoos/?hl=en),
[Lisa Eldridge](https://www.instagram.com/lisaeldridgemakeup/?hl=en) and
[Charlotte Tilbury](https://www.instagram.com/ctilburymakeup/?hl=en).)

A lot of things fell into place for me while I was working there. It was the
first time I'd worked closely with people that had a) done a Computer Science
degree and b) openly enjoyed it, which opened my eyes to a lot of things I
didn't know about algorithms, data structures and systems architecture. It was
the first time I'd really had to think about scale, which led to the decision
to use [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/), which later became my
introduction to [open source](open-source.html). And it was the first time I'd
had much exposure to roles outside of my own, including ops and project
management.

I think a large part of why I loved it so much was simply because it was hard.
I've done my fair share of
[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) apps by
now, and let's just say that I much prefer reasoning about race conditions or
evaluating a new recommendations algorithm!
Also, wrestling with those kinds of problems made me feel like a kid again.
I'm someone that likes learning about a lot of different things, which has led
to a few changes in direction over the years, but I associate maths and that
type of thinking with a time in my life when I could get lost in a problem and
only emerge when it was time for tea (and it was someone else's job to cook!).

I loved it so much that I've been trying to do similar ever since, first at
[Yossarian](https://yossarian.co/) and then at [Idio](https://idio.ai/).
Now that the kids are older, I've been studying in the evenings to supplement
what I've learned on the job. Due to the study, I'm starting to realise that
these are normally 2 quite distinct fields - it's only because I've been at
startups that it seems quite natural to me to combine them. I'm really looking
forward to putting some of that study into practice, starting with an attempt
to build a spam classifier.
