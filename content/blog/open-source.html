{% mark excerpt -%}

Day 4 fell on a Friday, which didn't feel like a good day to start on something
too ambitious, so I started looking around for a quick bugfix in an open source
project somewhere. Of course, there is no such thing as a quick bugfix,
especially when it's not my code - but it was a useful lesson in how to
contribute to open source.

I've done a little open source in the past, but I can still count my
[contributions](https://github.com/apache/storm/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ahmcc)
on one hand, so my experience level isn't far off "absolute beginner".
There are many great resources dedicated to helping beginners get started
(for example [this one](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)), but the
2 things I still struggle with are:

1. finding an issue to work on
2. dealing with people much smarter than I am

### Finding an issue

Before finding an issue, I need to find a project. I'm looking at
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
right now because:

* it's something I use
* it's something I'm curious about
* I've browsed around a bit and the community seemed friendly and respectful.

Many open source projects have an issue label for first-timers; for
Elasticsearch it's "good first issue". Also, I look for recent issues
which haven't already been claimed by someone else, and which haven't yet
descended into [bikeshedding](http://bikeshed.com/).

Go ahead and do the
[search](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+created%3A%3E2018-10-01+)
- maybe you'll get lucky. However, in my experience, **issues like this don't
exist**.

It's really easy to believe that this is because "the community doesn't want
my help" or even "I'm not good enough at this". However, if you've ever
mentored a junior developer (or been a junior developer), you'll know how hard
it is to come up with work that fits these criteria! I don't believe open
source organisations are any different - except that as well as their own
internal new developers, they're also dealing with external ones like me.

Here are some things that may help:

1. If you don't need to work on an issue right this second, then just check
back another day. There are even [tools](https://www.codetriage.com/) that
will automate the checking process.
2. Expand the search to more projects.
3. Create your own issue - this can be really small, such as a typo in the
documentation.
4. Work on an issue that no one else wants to touch.
5. Go down the rabbit hole!

"[Down the rabbit hole](https://code.likeagirl.io/down-the-rabbit-hole-how-i-taught-myself-to-code-became-an-engineer-dcb4517c4962)"
is an expression programmers often use to describe the process of digging deep
into something that they don't understand, especially if it isn't what they're
officially supposed to be doing at the time. It works really well for open
source because these projects are often huge, and sometimes chaotic, so if
you just start *somewhere* and follow your nose, it's likely you'll find
something useful to do before too long!

For example, I started off with an
[issue no one else wanted](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34264),
but couldn't get Elasticsearch to build. I worked out what it was pretty
quickly (I was missing an environment variable) but instead of setting it and
getting on with my day, I found myself curious about why the build output
hadn't told me what was wrong. 2 days and a crash course in
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) later, I'd created an
[issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37586) and
[2](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/37588)
[PRs](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/37589). Result!

### Dealing with smart people

I'm saying this slightly tongue-in-cheek, because like many developers
there's definitely some
[impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)
going on here. I've never worked in open source and don't know anyone who has,
so it's very easy to put open source developers into a separate "superhuman"
category to which I'll never belong. This is stupid, obviously, but I do it
anyway.

On the other hand, the developers of an open source project *do* know more
than me - probably about programming in general, and definitely about their
project in particular. So it's worth putting the effort in and being as sure
as I can of what I'm saying before I say it.

Here's how I try to walk that fine line between being too afraid of looking
like an idiot, and actually being one:

<i class="fa fa-times"></i> DON'T: sprinkle issues/PRs with "I think" and
"maybe". It's filler that no one needs to read. Either become sure, or
don't say it at all.

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> DO: be specific about my environment and what
I did. If I'm seeing something that no one else sees, chances are I'm doing
something that no one else does.

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> DO: prefer questions to statements if there's a
a chance that I don't have all the information. For example: "is this
variable used somewhere else?" vs "this variable is unused".

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> DO: iterate until I've done the best I can.
I had several theories about what was causing my missing error message; most
of them were wrong!

<i class="fa fa-times"></i> DON'T: be afraid to say "I don't know" (but make
it clear how I've tried to find out).

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> DO: be patient! The time it takes to get a
response does not mean that the work is bad - it just means no one has
read it yet.

<i class="fa fa-times"></i> DON'T: be discouraged if the reviewers request
changes or even reject the work altogether. They will have to live with it
for longer than I will! Be polite, thank them for their time, work with them
to find a way forward, ask for more context to help see what they see, and
above all, don't be afraid to try again.

**Update 18/01/2018**: The
[issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37586) I created got
a surprisingly quick response. They went with a different fix for the build
issue but the [docs PR](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/37589)
was merged, so I am now an Elasticsearch contributor!
