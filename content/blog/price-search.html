In our household, I am responsible for food planning, shopping, and cooking.
Each week I buy food for 3 meals a day, 7 days a week, for 2 adults, 1 
preschooler, and 1 baby. With [food prices rising in real terms by 12% 
since 2007][food-stats], I find I'm spending more and more of my time trying 
to make my budget go further.

With the rise of internet shopping, and in particular the supermarket 
comparison site [mySupermarket], it should be trivial to figure out the 
cheapest place to shop. [mySupermarket] automatically keeps track of the total 
cost of a trolley of goods in each of the main UK supermarkets, and allows you 
to choose the cheapest at the end.

The problem is that starting with a fixed shopping list and then working out 
the cheapest way to get it is a poor approximation of the way I actually shop.

My process is almost exactly the reverse of that promoted by [mySupermarket]. 
I identify what's cheap/in season **first**, and only then plan meals and write 
a shopping list. Also, the vast majority of my shopping is made up of things 
that I can easily store for a while (such as tinned tomatoes, teabags, pasta, 
rice, oils, spices, nappies, meat for the freezer, laundry detergent and 
bathroom products). That means that there are very few things I need to buy in 
any particular week; the things I choose to buy based on their current price 
and/or seasonality make up the majority of my shopping.

[mySupermarket] does provide the necessary data for this (in the form of 
"Savvy Buys" pages) but not the interface to go with it. The "price alerts"
feature is inadequate, because:

a) It sends an email if the price drops at all, even if the item is still
poor value

b) It sends one email per item

The only reliable way to identify good value items on the day I'm due to shop
is to sift through them manually. This is time-consuming and tedious (900+ 
items each week at my local supermarket) so [I decided to automate it]
[price-search-github].
