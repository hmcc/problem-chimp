In our household, I am responsible for food planning, shopping, and cooking.
Each week I buy food for 3 meals a day, 7 days a week, for 2 adults, 1 
preschooler, and 1 baby. With [food prices rising in real terms by 12% 
since 2007][food-stats], I find I'm spending more and more of my time trying 
to make my budget go further.

For a while, I used [mySupermarket] to help me find the cheapest place to shop.
However, after the first couple of weeks, I found the benefit to me was 
minimal, and it took me a while to figure out why.

The problem is that the site expects me to do this:
<ul>
  <li>Start with a fixed shopping list</li>
  <li>Work out the cheapest way to get it</li>
</ul>
**This is a very poor approximation of the way I actually shop.**

My process is almost exactly the reverse of that promoted by [mySupermarket]. 
I identify what's cheap/in season **first**, and only then plan meals and write 
a shopping list. I don't need a tool that tells me where to buy something; I
need to know when to buy it, in the same way as using [CamelCamelCamel] for 
[Amazon] shopping.

[mySupermarket] does provide the necessary data for this (in the form of 
"Savvy Buys" pages) but not the interface to go with it, so I end up sifting 
through them manually. This is time-consuming and tedious (900+ items each 
week at [ASDA]) so [I decided to automate it]
[price-search-github].
