{% mark excerpt -%}

It's taken me a while to get around to writing about this, because after
[all](distributed-systems-getting-started-1.html)
[that](java-nio.html)
[preparation](jmdns.html), implementing my first distributed algorithm was a
bit of a let-down! The problem (if you can call it a problem) is that vector
clocks are actually really easy.

{%- endmark %}


I like the summary of the algorithm in
[chapter 3 of Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/time.html)
(and I hope it's OK to repeat it here):

* Whenever a process does work, increment its clock
* Whenever a process sends a message, include the full vector of clocks
* Whenever a process receives a message:
     * Update its clock to be `max(local, received)`
     * Increment its clock

There are some small discrepancies between the algorithm as given here
and the instructions in the
[assignment](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jakangas/Teaching/DSP-11/DSP-Assignment2.pdf)
I was using (there's no distinction between "doing work" and "receiving a
message", and I needed to support incrementing the clock by arbitrary amounts)
but the
[implementation](https://github.com/hmcc/vector-clock/blob/master/src/main/java/org/problemchimp/vectorclock/handler/IncomingVectorClockHandler.java)
is still simple:

**Send**
<pre>
<span class="pl-k">protected void</span> <span class="pl-en">handleMessage</span>(VectorClockMessage <span class="pl-v">message</span>) {
	message<span class="pl-k">.</span>setClock(vectorClock);
	ServiceInfo service <span class="pl-k">=</span> registry<span class="pl-k">.</span>find(message<span class="pl-k">.</span>getService());
	<span class="pl-k">if</span> (service <span class="pl-k">==</span> null) {
		<span class="pl-cl">super</span><span class="pl-k">.</span>sendToAll(message);
	} <span class="pl-k">else</span> {
		<span class="pl-cl">super</span><span class="pl-k">.</span>sendToService(service, message);
	}
}
</pre>

**Receive**
<pre>
<span class="pl-k">protected void</span> <span class="pl-en">handleMessage</span>(VectorClockMessage <span class="pl-v">message</span>) {
  <span class="pl-k">if</span> (message<span class="pl-k">.</span>getClock() <span class="pl-k">!=</span> <span class="pl-cl">null</span>) {
      vectorClock<span class="pl-k">.</span>merge(message<span class="pl-k">.</span>getClock());
  }
  <span class="pl-k">if</span> (message<span class="pl-k">.</span>getAmount() <span class="pl-k">==</span> <span class="pl-cl">null</span> <span class="pl-k">||</span> message<span class="pl-k">.</span>getAmount() <span class="pl-k"><=</span> <span class="pl-cl">1</span>) {
    vectorClock<span class="pl-k">.</span>increment(thisService<span class="pl-k">.</span>getName());
  } <span class="pl-k">else</span> {
    vectorClock<span class="pl-k">.</span>increment(thisService<span class="pl-k">.</span>getName(), message<span class="pl-k">.</span>getAmount());
  }
}
</pre>

However, working with Spring Boot was not so simple.

I don't have a strong opinion about frameworks - I've seen good and bad work
done with and without them. However, they definitely come with a learning
curve, and right now I'm somewhere to the left of it.

That means that this project has ended up being less about learning vector
clocks, and more about learning Spring Boot.
I wasn't feeling great about that, but then I thought of some reasons why that
might not be such a bad thing:

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> It's a natural side effect of not knowing what I'm doing, and not knowing what I'm doing is [the whole point right now](retreat.html)

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> I still learned lots, so that's a win

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> I still consider Java my first language, but
haven't written in it regularly for a couple of years, and it's been nice to
spend time with it again

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> The algorithms will get harder and when they do,
I should feel the benefit more

<i class="fa fa-check"></i> I'm much more likely to use Spring Boot in future than I am to use vector
clocks :)
