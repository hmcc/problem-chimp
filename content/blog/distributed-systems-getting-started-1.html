There are loads of great resources for getting started with Machine Learning.
All the major MOOC providers run at least one introductory course (and usually
several others on related topics like Deep Learning).

{%- endmark %}

For example:

* Coursera: [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
* edX: [Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning)
* Udacity: [Machine Learning](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z&trade;](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)

Now, here's the best result I see for "Distributed Systems" for each of the 4 providers above:

* Coursera: [Distributed Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/distributed-programming-in-java)
* edX: Reliable Distributed Algorithms [1](https://www.edx.org/course/reliable-distributed-algorithms-part-1-kthx-id2203-1x-0) and [2](https://www.edx.org/course/reliable-distributed-algorithms-part-2-kthx-id2203-2x)
* Udacity: [Advanced Operating Systems](https://eu.udacity.com/course/advanced-operating-systems--ud189)
* Udemy: [Akka Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/akka-essentials/)

Coursera and Udemy are specific "how to use technology X" courses, which is not
what I'm trying to do here - I've already *used* technology X, Y and Z, but I'd
like to understand *why*. Udacity looks OK, but it's only 3 lectures as part of
a bigger course. The edX ones are the best match, but they're not currently
running and haven't been for at least 6 months.

It's a similar story for programming examples. Machine Learning has
[100 Days of ML](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code) and
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), but Distributed Systems seems to be
geared towards bigger, more mature projects (e.g.
[Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/),
[Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/),
[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)). While I'm definitely open to
doing a bit more [open source](open-source.html) sometime soon, I'm
struggling to find anything starter-sized. (If you can, please
[let me know](/contact).)

Fortunately, [I used to be a teacher](/about), so learning how to learn is
something I can do! I've now made a
[list](https://github.com/hmcc/distributed-systems-exercises) of Distributed
Systems programming exercises, taken from various university courses,
organized by topic and correlated with papers from the courses themselves and
from the list at
[awesome-distributed-systems](https://github.com/theanalyst/awesome-distributed-systems).

It's not what I was planning to do today, but hopefully it will be useful to
someone!
