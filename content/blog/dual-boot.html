{% mark excerpt -%}

Before I can start playing around with some more interesting things, I need a
computer to play around on them with. My desktop has Windows 10 as a base with
Ubuntu running inside [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox),
but I want to dual boot Ubuntu instead.
I've dual booted before, so I thought I knew what I was doing, but it turns out
that I was just lucky all those other times because this time it got a lot more
interesting, and I ended up learning lots about UEFI and BIOS and why the
differences are important.

The internet is full of "how to dual boot" guides.
If you read carefully, you'll see that the better
ones are really, really specific about who the guide is for. Here is an example
of a specific title:

> [How to dual boot Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10 on a PC with UEFI firmware](http://linuxbsdos.com/2016/06/05/dual-boot-ubuntu-16-04-and-windows-10-on-a-pc-with-uefi-firmware/)

The trouble is that
a) not all guides are so specific about who they're for 
b) even if they are specific, you may not notice
c) even if you notice, it's much more fun to believe that the specifics don't
matter and to just go for it anyway and
d) even if you are prepared to admit that the specifics matter, you may not
know how to find them out.

And that may be fine, or it may lead to scouring forums for stuff like
"Ubuntu installer can't find my Windows installation", or worse.

So here is my guide to choosing a guide:

(I followed both "no idea"s, learned a lot of stuff, and ended up [converting Windows to GPT](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/support/articles/000024558/memory-and-storage/intel-optane-memory.html).)

<h3 id="uefi">What's UEFI and why is it important?</h3>

For a much better explanation, I really recommend AdamW's
[UEFI boot: how does that actually work, then?](https://www.happyassassin.net/2014/01/25/uefi-boot-how-does-that-actually-work-then/),
but to summarise:

* In the beginning, IBM compatible PCs used to run
[BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) firmware.
* [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface)
is a newer type of firmware that is designed to be more cross-compatible.
* BIOS and UEFI imply different layouts on disk; BIOS implies
[MBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) while UEFI implies
[GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table). So an OS is
installed "for" BIOS or UEFI by using one of these layouts.
* UEFI firmware can often still use an MBR layout, for backwards
compatibility. So it's possible to have UEFI firmware, but Windows installed
in "BIOS mode".
* When dual booting, *avoid mixing the two styles*. If one OS is
installed "for" UEFI, then any others should be too.

<h3 id="firmware-mode">How to find out if a PC has UEFI firmware</h3>

The easiest way to find out is probably to
<a href="https://superuser.com/a/946884">check the BIOS mode setting in Windows</a>.
If that's UEFI, then the firmware must be UEFI as well.

However, if Windows is installed in BIOS mode, that doesn't necessarily mean
that the firmware is not UEFI, because of backwards compatibility - so you
will have to roll up your sleeves and check your firmware settings. 

It's best to find specific instructions for your PC, but in general:

* On startup, open the firmware settings by using the hotkey. This will usually
appear briefly on screen before Windows loads. Common hotkeys are F2, F10 or
Del.
* Look for "UEFI" in the boot options, and/or look for "Secure Boot" - this is
only supported in UEFI.

----
**Note**: I do realise that dual boot is actually a terrible idea. It's much
simpler (and safer) to have one OS and use
[virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) instead. I only
put myself through this because:

* I have found the performance of Ubuntu in VirtualBox to be terrible.
* Ubuntu 18 [isn't officially supported](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/support/index.html) in VirtualBox.
* Ubuntu is my "main" machine i.e. I use IDEs and such in it, and unlike
practially everyone else, I *like* the efforts Canonical are making with the
UI, so I'm reluctant to swap it for a less graphically rich <del>ugly</del>
Linux. Sorry.
* But Windows is also my "main" machine, because my kids play games on it (and
occasionally so do I).
* There's very little overlap between the things I do with Windows and the
things I do with Linux, so I don't need any of the clever solutions that
seamlessly swap between the two, although some of them do sound cool and I may
try them later.
