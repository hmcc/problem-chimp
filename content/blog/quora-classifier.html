{% mark excerpt -%}

Following my relative success with the [spam classifier](spam-classifier.html),
I decided that a good next step would be to enter a competition on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), for cash, to
[classify questions on Quora](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification).
I mean, I've worked alongside data scientists 3 times now (and even understood
a lot of what they said), I've taken a
[course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/), and I've built
a working [spam classifier](https://github.com/hmcc/spam-classifier). How hard
could it be?

It turns out it's actually quite hard.

So what went wrong?

* The task is as much an NLP task as a ML one. I've done a little NLP, but it
was far too [specific](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~es407/papers/Coling10.pdf) to
be any use here. I'm going to add
[this introductory NLP course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) to my
todo list!
* I wasn't social enough - many of the top performing kernels were based on
the work of others.
* My spam classifier didn't scale well. I was aware that it wouldn't, but I
underestimated how much time it would take me to fix this, meaning that I
didn't really have enough time overall.

I would have loved to keep going with it, because it's been a lot of fun, but
at 4 weeks into a 6 week "[retreat](retreat.html)" I think I need to be a bit
more selective about how I spend my time, and a lot less ambitious :)
