{% mark excerpt -%}

I've been working as a developer for 14 years now. I am really, really
lucky to love what I do. However, the more experienced I become, the harder
I find it to spend quality time learning and growing (as a developer), because
of all the other stuff I end up doing as well.

{%- endmark %}

For example:

* interviewing
* mentoring
* issue management
* firefighting
* support

That's not to say that this stuff isn't good, or that I don't want to do more
of it some day (I'd quite like to move into a tech lead role sometime, which
will definitely involve even more of this stuff) - but before I do, I want to
take some time out to dig into things a bit more deeply and reflect on what
I've been doing over the past few years.

In particular, I'm hoping to take my knowledge of Machine Learning and/or
Distributed Systems from "hmmm, that sounds cool, I'd like to know a bit more
about that" to ... whatever the next stage after that is :)

### Approach
I love the idea of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in New York.
While I sadly can't manage an in-person retreat there, I'm going to borrow
their [approach](https://www.recurse.com/about), because I believe it's a good
one, especially for someone like me who thrives in a traditional educational
setup but sometimes struggles when things are less clear-cut. 

That means I want to be:

* working at the edge of my understanding (which means that there's a good chance some things won't work out, and that's OK)
* self-directed
* project based
* social where possible (for example working on open source projects)

### Constraints
* I've given myself about 6 weeks to do this before I start looking for a real
job. I'm already learning that that's not as much time as I think it is!
* Since I'm not earning, I'll be doing both ends of the school run for the time
being, so my working day is only about 6 hours long.
* I'm finding the writing to be very slow going at the minute, although
hopefully that will improve.

All of that means that while I'd like to be one of those people that has
something new to say every day, I'm more likely to work in 2-5 day chunks.
Stay tuned!
